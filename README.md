# Umbrella Weather App

## Description
The challenge was to design and develop a weather dashboard web application powered by OpenWeatherMap APIs. Umbrella allows users to search weather data by city, and it saves the user's searched locations in local storage.

## Usage
The websiteâ€™s URL is https://umbrella-weather.onrender.com. Screenshots can be viewed below. In order to use the Umbrella app, allow location access to view local weather, or use the search bar to look up weather by city.
